# Open Dashcam  
This project implements an Open Source Dashcam.  
I am personally frustrated that paid, closed source dashcams lack simple features or don't fully work as they should. Hence, this project.  
This project aims to provide a dashcam that anyone can buy and use, implementing any features they wish and sharing those features with others.  
  
## Construction  
This section is mostly a work-in-progress, my current equipment list is:  
- Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, with heat sink  
- ZeroCam FishEye  
- 3D Printed case  

## Contributions  
There are lots of features I want to add to this dashcam, if you think you can help with any, contributions are encouraged and welcomed.  
Some are:  
- Connection with a mobile phone app (both Android and iOS) to view and delete videos, as well as create video clips to share with others  
- GPS tracking data on all video clips  
- Cloud storage integration (likely S3 / personal NAS) so that videos are backed up and watchable wherever and whenever  
- Microphone integration for recording audio alongside video  
- Cabin-facing camera for drivers  
- Auto-locking clips with accelerometer  
- Auto storage management that will remove old videos from the device, or remove videos that are backed up elsewhere  
  
If any of these sound like something you'd like to help with, please feel free to implement.
